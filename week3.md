# Week 3. Making digital tools sustainable (and saving money for it)

## Content
The more resources you use in your digital infrastructure, the higher the emissions and, typically, the higher the bills. 

Well-designed well-coded digital tools can be both sustainable and significantly cheaper to run than less intelligent approaches – with some actors claiming savings can be as much as 80%.

Equally, several other project decisions like, for instance, type of server/cloud infrastructure, cain significantly increase or decrease, both, the sustainability and costs of any digital solution.
