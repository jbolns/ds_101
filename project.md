# Optional project. Digital project planning.

## Description
This course is not graded. However, students will be given the option to form teams to put together a project plan defining the stages of setting up an online company that aims to solve a sustainability problem. 

The projects will then be ranked from most to least sensible. 
Submissions must include details about the two sides of the digital sustainability challenge:
*	How the students plan to maximise the sustainability of their digital infrastructure and the cost-savings this represents vis-à-vis other approaches
*	How the resulting tools can help to solve real-world sustainability problems.

Since the project is not graded, students are encouraged to do a good job so that they can benefit from the learning experience and feedback. Else, they’re wasting everyone’s time, including their own.
