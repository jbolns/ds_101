# Week 1. The context

## Content
Sustainability is no longer entirely optional: 
* While not uncontroversial, standards and legislation asking companies to engage in one or another form of sustainability reporting are becoming increasingly common – especially in the EU. 

Sustainability can enable access to better financing is possible:
* Banks and investors globally now often ask for environmental, social, and governance (ESG) risk disclosure and information about the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as part of their financing process. 

Requirements on companies will vary per region and size, inter alia, but they likely will mean a need for data gathering, analysis, and reporting. Pressure to lower the environmental impact of digital activities might also increase as a result.
