# DS (Digital Sustainability) 101 â€“ A cost-aware introduction to digital sustainability

## Summary
This repository contains the course syllabus for an introductory mini-course to digital sustainability. The course emphasises the connection between **doing digital things sustainably** and **saving** and/or **making money** for it.

## Justification 
One of the hardest challenges in digital sustainability is the preconception that sustainability is expensive. The objective with this course is to debunk this preconception by introducing users to digital sustainability while emphasising the ability to save and/or make money from it.

## Usage
**Related services.** I am happy to help universities, companies, and/or organisations implement this course as part of their teaching/training. The course can be given in full, or condensed into a 2-hour seminar.

The mini-course can already be helpful, reason why it was open-sourced it. That said, I am also gathering feedback and literature suggestions to potentially add in future revisions.
