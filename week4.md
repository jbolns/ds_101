# Week 4. Using digital tools for sustainability (and making money for it)

## Content
Digital tools can do a lot for sustainability. As concern about climate change grows, opportunities will be available for those able to deliver digital tools that solve real-world sustainability problems. 

However, any such tools need to be sustainable and cost-efficient. This is not idealism. It is a simple market reality. 

If they are not sustainable, there is a significant risk of greenwashing scandals and potentially even lawsuits. If they are not cost-effective, it will be very hard to get buy-in.
